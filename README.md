This project leverages cutting-edge machine learning techniques to predict stock market movements. It combines neural networks with Word2Vec word embeddings to analyze text data, identify patterns, and improve prediction accuracy. Built using Keras, scikit-learn, pandas, and gensim, the model integrates financial data and sentiment analysis for a comprehensive predictive framework.

Features:
Word Embedding with Word2Vec:
	•	Textual data (e.g., financial news, social media sentiment) is vectorized using Word2Vec from Gensim, converting words into high-dimensional vectors that capture semantic relationships.

Neural Networks with Hidden Layers:
	•	Built with Keras, the neural network incorporates multiple hidden layers for feature extraction and complex pattern recognition.

Machine Learning Pipeline:
	•	Integrated with scikit-learn for preprocessing, model evaluation, and performance metrics.

Performance Evaluation:
	•	Comprehensive evaluation of model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and mean squared error (MSE)
